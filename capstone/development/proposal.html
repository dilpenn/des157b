    <h1>Capstone Proposal</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Topic</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to highlight the experiences of a UC Davis student living in Davis, from dorming during freshman year to graduating in their final year. Although we spend a lot of time on campus as students, we also spend a considerable amount of time around the city. This project will visualize both on-campus and off-campus landmarks and experiences of Davis.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>In general, the target audience is UC Davis students, but can be split into 3 specific categories: incoming, current, and past students. By interacting with the interface, incoming students can have a better understanding of what living in Davis is like as a student. This project will be the most relevant to current students as they are the ones actively experiencing life in Davis. Alumni may experience nostalgia as they reflect on their past experiences as a student.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>I envision the interface as an interactive parallax story. As the user scrolls, different visuals move in and out of the scene. For example, a Unitrans bus may slide across the screen as the user scrolls. At the end, the user will have the option to input a message about how Davis has become a home for them.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I'm most concerned with the difficulties that may come with building a parallax interface. I will have to deal with a lot of image files and ensure they are positioned properly and move at the proper pace and order. Ideally I would highlight all 4 years of the college experience in Davis, but I could consider shrinking the scope to make the workload more manageable.</p>

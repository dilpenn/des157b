    <p>Through testing, it was intuitive to my user that I am portraying the undergraduate experience at Davis from freshman year to graduation. Despite this, my user was not sure if she was supposed to continue "scrolling" while the animations are happening. I think this will be more intuitive on an actual interactive screen. It wasn't very easy for me to smoothly replace and move the illustrations around. In terms of the visual style of my final product, my user had an idea of using both photos and illustrations, similar to the style of a scrapbook or collage. I may consider implementing this idea.</p>

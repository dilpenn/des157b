        <p>By user testing the current version of my capstone project with 2 peers, I have 3 significant observations: the navigations are intuitive, the parallax animations need improvements, and the form needs to be styled further.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Intuitive Navigations</h2>
        <p>When tasked with scrolling through the parallax, starting over, and filling out the form, both users were easily able to navigate to the correct buttons/interactions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Parallax Animations</h2>
        <p>My peers were easily able to scroll through the parallax interface. Although they commented that the animations felt smooth, the transitions between each scene felt abrupt.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Form Styling</h2>
        <p>The lack of margin spacing on the form created an eye-sore for the users. During the first user test, the overlays from the intro screen were not hidden when the user opened the form. The text from the overlays and the form interfered and made the page very difficult to read.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Planned Improvements</h2>
        <p>For the parallax animations, I plan on attempting to hide some elements before it is the right time for them to appear. This way, elements from each scene won't look like they are interfering with each other. I will also change the placeholder background colors that differentiate each scene for a more put-together storyline.</p>
        <p>I haven't yet styled the user input form much beyond what it is by default. I need to ensure that the elements are spaced legibly apart from each other. I also need to ensure that all elements that should be hidden do not appear once the user opens the form.</p>

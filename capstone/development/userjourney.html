    <h1>User Journey</h1>

    <p>After testing my user journey with my classmate, I realized it wasn't clear how my interface works from my illustrations. There was confusion about whether the entire screen moves at once, or if the individual elements move on their own. I was also asked about how my project relates to Davis' seal. Although my project is a more modern/current-day representation of the city, it relates to historical visuals on the seal as well. My project focuses on students' experiences specifically, which are an integral part of Davis' history. Additionally, my classmate suggested including major Davis events, like the various festivals held on campus, as a part of my visuals.</p>

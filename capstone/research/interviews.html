        <h1>Target Audience Interviews</h1>
        <p>My target audience includes incoming, current, and past students of UC Davis. I interviewed 2 people who fit 2 out of the 3 categories. Although students spend almost 4 years in Davis, I realized that they spend a majority of their time at home and/or on campus. Both interviewees commented on the small, college-town nature of Davis as well as their interest in visiting the arboretum and the role of academics in their Davis experience. I initially intended on focusing on a student's experience in general, incorporating pieces relevant to both on and off campus. After these interviews, I may consider incorporating more elements about UC Davis specifically. This makes sense considering who my target audience is.</p>

        <h2>Current Student</h2>
        <p>Leon is a UC Davis senior majoring in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. He only spends about a third of his time outside, which is generally on campus. Although Davis has an abundance of local businesses, many of his favorite off-campus locations were chains (like Safeway and TJ Maxx). Despite this, his favorite activities were unique to the city, like spending time in downtown to shop and eat, the farmers market for produce and apple juice, and the arboretum to watch ducks and squirrels.</p>

        <h2>Past Student</h2>
        <p>Bukre is a UC Davis alumni who graduated 5 years ago with a degree in Cell Biology. Similarly, most of her time spent outside was on campus, attending classes or her internship at the time. She emphasized that her experience in Davis was mainly shaped by academics rather than socializing. In fact, she described her representation of Davis as a "cow in an OChem lab wearing goggles and a lab coat". Some of her favorite locations were the arboretum to take a break from classes, a boba shop to grab drinks with her roommates, Sam's Mediterranean for burgers, and Hutchison parking structure to watch the sunset and attend club meetups.</p>

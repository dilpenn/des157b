    <h1>Capstone: Annotated Bibliography</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Source 1: "California's College Town"</h2>
        <p>This article on UC Davis' official site briefly provides information about Davis as a college town. It isn't very text heavy but rather provides a lot of images and visuals, which could be helpful for my project specifically. It lists features unique to Davis as links that lead to other sources. For example, a user can learn more about bike lanes and safety by clicking on the "Bike-friendly roads: 98%" link. The additional sources can help me build a storyline for my parallax project.</p>

        <h2>Source 2: "Top 10 Pros and Cons of Living in Davis, CA"</h2>
        <p>This article briefly describes each point and why they are either a "pro" or a "con" for living in Davis. The information isn't directed at students looking to live in Davis, but rather those who are in the workforce. As a result, some points are irrelevant to my project, like the relative location of Davis, living costs, etc. On the other hand, it lists popular landmarks and event, like the farmers market, which can help solidify my ideas. Despite this, there is no information on the author that can confirm their credibility.</p>

        <h2>Source 3: "Living the Davis Life"</h2>
        <p>This article is posted on the official Yolo county website. Relative to the other two sources, this site is longer and more text-heavy. It provides fun facts, historical information and even Davis traditions (some that even I wasn't aware of). This is a good source to learn interesting information about the city and can give me a better idea of the background of the elements I choose to include in my project.</p>

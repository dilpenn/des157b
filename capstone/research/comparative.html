        <h2>Every Last Drop</h2>
        <img src="images/everylastdrop.gif">
        <p><a href="http://everylastdrop.co.uk/">Every Last Drop</a> is an interactive parallax interface that brings awareness to water waste in the UK. The use of many colors, friendly illustrations, and motion of the elements creates an engaging interface. The details of the transitions are well-thoughout, from the background changes to the outfit changes of the character. Despite this, I don't believe the impact of water waste is highlighted well-enough. The text that accompanies the visuals is small and can be easily dismissed.</p>

        <h2>The Boat</h2>
        <img src="images/theboat.gif">
        <p><a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/">The Boat</a> is another interactive parallax interface, but this one is in the form of a graphic novel of the story of Vietnamese refugees. Compared to "Every Last Drop", this piece has a lot more motion with the raindrops coming down on the entire screen. The music and sound effects set the tone for the story. Movement that occurs in sync with the sound effects, like the sudden movement of the image and text when thunder strikes, makes the experience a lot more engaging. Although the theme and color scheme are very consistent, the text can sometimes be difficult to read due to a lack of contrast.</p>
